im working on a program that show if the email is a spam eamil or not.the sapms emails is a clustering probleme. 
most of the time the people who make a spam email target some people and they espect to learn or take some sensitive informations from the target.
Ex:
let's say that a big company is targeted by some attackers or hackers so they send spam emails to that company so get there infromation.
